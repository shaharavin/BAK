# BAK

BAK is a card game loosely inspired by concerns about [managing extreme technological risks](https://www.cser.ac.uk/research/managing-extreme-technological-risks/), 
especially in the context of [artificial intelligence](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html).

Each player aims to have the highest value hand by the end of the game, and needs to make choices about investing in capabilities (drawing more cards), foresight (looking ahead and rearranging the deck) or safety (protection from adverse effects). 
Safety is treated as a commons, adding a potential failure of [cooperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04534).
